# GitHub Workflow

- **Clone repo once:**  
  `git clone <repo-url>`

- **Branching:**  
  - Never code on `main`  
  - New branch format: `Lastname-feature`  
    Example: `Smith-login`

- **Work on your branch:**  
  - Commit often, write clear and concise messages. Use AI for commit messages if need be.

- **Pull Request (PR):**  
  - Push branch -> Open PR -> Describe changes  
  - I or another teammate will review PRs before merging

- **Major features:**  
  - Major features should always be on their own branch
